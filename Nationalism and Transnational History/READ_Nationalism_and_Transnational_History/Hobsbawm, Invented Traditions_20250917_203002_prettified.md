## Invented Traditions

Eric Hobsbawm

Nothing appears more ancient and linked to an immemorial past than the pageantry that surrounds the British monarchy in its public ceremonial manifestations. Yet, as a chapter in this book establishes, in its modern form it is the product of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. 'Traditions' which appear or claim to be old are often quite recent in origin and sometimes invented. Anyone familiar with the colleges of ancient British universities will be able to think of the institution of such 'traditions' on a local scale, though some‚Äîlike the annual Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols in the chapel of King's College, Cambridge on Christmas Eve‚Äîmay become generalized through the modern mass medium of radio. This observation formed the starting point of a conference organized by the historical journal *Past & Present*, which in turn forms the basis of the present book.

The term 'invented tradition' is used in a broad, but not imprecise sense. It includes both 'traditions' actually invented, constructed, and formally instituted, and those emerging in a less easily traceable manner within a brief and dateable period‚Äîa matter of a few years perhaps‚Äîand establishing themselves with great rapidity. The royal Christmas broadcast in Britain (instituted in 1932) is an example of the first; the appearance and development of the practices associated with the Cup Final in British Association Football is an example of the second. It is evident that not all of them are equally permanent, but it is their appearance and establishment rather than their chances of survival which are our primary concern.

'Invented tradition' is taken to mean a set of practices, normally governed by overtly or tacitly accepted rules and of a ritual or symbolic nature, which seek to inculcate certain values and norms of behavior by repetition, which automatically implies continuity with the past. In fact, where possible, they normally attempt to establish continuity with a suitable historic past. A striking example is the deliberate choice of a Gothic style for the nineteenth-century rebuilding of the British Parliament, and the equally deliberate decision after World War II to rebuild the parliamentary chamber on exactly the same basic plan as before. The historic past into which the new tradition is inserted need not be lengthy, stretching back into the assumed mists of time. Revolutions and 'progressive movements' which break with the past, by definition, have their own relevant past, though it may be cut off at a certain date, such as 1789. However, insofar as there is such reference to a historic past, the peculiarity of 'invented' traditions is that the continuity with it is largely factitious. In short, they are responses to novel situations which take the form of reference to old situations, or which establish their own 'past' by quasi-obligatory repetition. It is the contrast between the constant change and innovation of the modern world and the structure of at least some areas of social life within it as unchanging and invariant that makes the 'invention of tradition' so interesting for historians of the past two centuries.

    This is reminding me of people who say "it's always been done that way" and Boomers, who "don't want anything to change", but the interesting part is that many quotes refer to change being inevitable, and many motivational speakers talk about embracing change

## 'Tradition' and 'Custom'

'Tradition' in this sense must be distinguished clearly from 'custom,' which dominates so-called 'traditional' societies. The object and characteristic of 'traditions,' including invented ones, is invariance. The past, real or invented, to which they refer imposes fixed (normally formalized) practices, such as repetition. 'Custom' in traditional societies has the double function of motor and flywheel. It does not preclude innovation and change up to a point, though evidently the requirement that it must appear compatible or even identical with precedent imposes substantial limitations on it. What it does is to give any desired change (or resistance to innovation) the sanction of precedent, social continuity, and natural law as expressed in history.

Students of peasant movements know that a village's claim to some common land or right 'by custom from time immemorial' often expresses not a historical fact, but the balance of forces in the constant struggle of village against lords or against other villages. Students of the British labour movement know that 'the custom of the trade' or of the shop may represent not ancient tradition, but whatever right the workers have established in practice, however recently, and which they now attempt to extend or defend by giving customary sanction or the sanction of perpetuity. Common law still shows this combination of flexibility in substance and formal adherence to precedent. The difference between 'tradition' and 'custom' in our sense is indeed well illustrated here.

<div style="background-color: #e6ffe6; border-left: 4px solid #4dff4d; padding: 12px; margin: 12px 0; border-radius: 6px; color: #2c2c2c; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
    <strong>üìù NOTE (2025-09-17 23:19):</strong><br>
    In this way it is difficult to tell the difference between custom and reparations?
</div>



### The Role of Custom

'Custom' surrounds substantial action. The decline of 'custom' inevitably changes the 'tradition' with which it is habitually intertwined. This is what judges do; 'tradition' (in this instance invented tradition) is the wig, robe, and other formal paraphernalia and ritualized practices.

A second, less important distinction that must be made is between 'tradition' in our sense and convention or routine, which has no significant ritual or symbolic function as such, though it may acquire it incidentally. It is evident that any social practice that needs to be carried out repeatedly will tend, for convenience and efficiency, to develop a set of such conventions and routines, which may be de facto or de jure formalized for the purposes of imparting the practice to new practitioners. This applies to unprecedented practices (such as the work of an aircraft pilot) as much as to long-familiar ones.

### The Impact of Industrialization

Societies since the industrial revolution have naturally been obliged to invent, institute, or develop new networks of such convention or routine more frequently than previous ones. Insofar as they function best when turned into habit, automatic procedure, or even reflex action, they require invariance, which may get in the way of the other necessary requirement of practice: the capacity to deal with unforeseen or inhabitual contingencies. This is a well-known weakness of routinization or bureaucratization, particularly at the subaltern levels where invariant performance is generally considered the most efficient.

<div style="background-color: #fff2e6; border-left: 4px solid #ff8800; padding: 12px; margin: 12px 0; border-radius: 6px; color: #2c2c2c; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
    <strong>‚ùì QUESTION (2025-09-17 23:21):</strong><br>
    Is this referring to mass production, or the industrial revolution?
</div>



Such networks of convention and routine are not 'invented traditions,' since their functions, and therefore their justifications, are technical rather than ideological (in Marxian terms, they belong to 'base' rather than 'superstructure'). They are designed to facilitate a practice abandoned to meet practical needs, always allowing for the changing inertia which any practice acquires with time and the emotional resistance to any innovation by people who have become attached to it.

### Pragmatic Norms and Tradition

The same applies to the recognized 'rules' of games or other patterns of social interaction, where these exist, or to any other pragmatically based norms. Where these exist in combination with 'tradition,' the difference is readily observable. Wearing hard hats when riding makes practical sense, like wearing crash helmets for motorcyclists or steel helmets for soldiers; wearing a particular type of hard hat in combination with hunting pink makes an entirely different kind of sense. If this were not so, it would be as easy to change the 'traditional' costume of fox-hunters as it is to substitute a differently shaped helmet in armies‚Äîrather conservative institutions‚Äîif it can be shown to provide more effective protection.

<div style="background-color: #e6ffe6; border-left: 4px solid #4dff4d; padding: 12px; margin: 12px 0; border-radius: 6px; color: #2c2c2c; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
    <strong>üìù NOTE (2025-09-18 12:52):</strong><br>
    This again reminds me of meeting people who think that things work a certain way, which is how Herder seemed to think.
</div>



Indeed, it may be suggested that 'traditions' and pragmatic conventions or routines are inversely related. 'Tradition' shows weakness when, as among liberal Jews, dietary prohibitions are justified pragmatically, as by arguing that the ancient Hebrews banned pork on grounds of hygiene. Conversely, objects or practices are liberated for full symbolic and ritual use when no longer fettered by practical use. The spurs of cavalry officers' dress uniforms are of little importance for 'tradition' when there are no horses; the umbrellas of Guards officers in civilian dress lose their significance when not carried tightly furled (that is, useless); the wigs of lawyers could hardly acquire their modern significance until other people stopped wearing wigs.

# Swiss Nationalism and the Development of New Traditions

## Introduction

Inventing traditions, it is assumed here, is essentially a process of formalization and ritualization, characterized by reference to the past, if only by imposing repetition. The actual process of creating such ritual and symbolic complexes has not been adequately studied by historians. Much of it is still rather obscure. It is presumably most clearly exemplified where a 'tradition' is deliberately invented and constructed by a single initiator, as for the Boy Scouts by Baden-Powell. Perhaps it is almost as easily traced in the case of officially instituted and planned ceremonials, since they are likely to be well documented, as in the case of the construction of Nazi symbolism and the Nuremberg party rallies. It is probably most difficult to trace where such traditions are partly invented, partly evolved in private groups (where the process is less likely to be bureaucratically recorded), or informally over a period of time as, say, in parliament and the legal profession. The difficulty is not only one of sources but also of techniques, though there are available both esoteric disciplines specializing in symbolism and ritual, such as heraldry and the study of liturgy, as well as Warburgian historic disciplines for the study of such subjects. Unfortunately, neither are usually familiar to historians of the industrial era.

There is probably no time and place with which historians are concerned that has not seen the 'invention' of tradition in this sense. However, we should expect to occur more frequently when a rapid transformation of society weakens or destroys the social patterns for which 'old' traditions had been designed, producing new ones to which they were not applicable, or when such old traditions and their institutional carriers and promulgators no longer prove significant in the past 200 years. It is therefore reasonable to expect these instant formalizations of new traditions to cluster during this period. This implies, incidentally, against both nineteenth-century and more recent modernization theories that such formalizations are essential.

## The Role of Ancient Materials in New Traditions

The eighteenth century saw a significant number of exoduses, with fifty recorded in 1800-48 and only six from 1848 to 1973. This document focuses on the use of ancient materials to construct invented traditions for novel purposes, particularly during the development of Swiss nationalism and the formation of the modern federal state in the nineteenth century.

A large store of such materials is accumulated in any society, and an elaborate language of symbolic practice and communication is always available. New traditions can be readily grafted onto old ones or devised by borrowing from official rituals, symbolism, and moral exhortation. This allows for the development of new song repertoires, especially for schools, which are patriotic-progressive in nature and embody ritually powerful elements from religious hymnology.

## The Federal Song Festival

The statutes of the Federal Song Festival declare its object to be "the development and improvement of the people's singing, the awakening of more elevated sentiments for God, Freedom and Country, union and fraternization of the friends of Art and the Fatherland." This festival architecture is reminiscent of baroque forms of celebration, display, and pomp.

## The Emergence of New Traditions

An alloy of religious and patriotic elements emerges from these new forms of choral, shooting, and gymnastic activity. This is evident in the development of national anthems, national flags, and the personification of 'the nation' in symbol or image.

## The Break in Continuity

The break in continuity can be seen in movements for the defense of traditional ways, such as English Christmas folk carols ceasing to be created in the seventeenth century and being replaced by hymn-book carols of the Watts-Wesley kind. However, these carols were revived by middle-class collectors to take their place in novel surroundings of church, guild, and women's institute, spreading in a new urban popular setting through street-corner singers or hoarse boys chanting on doorsteps.

## The Invented Traditions of the Period Since the Industrial Revolution

Invented traditions seem to belong to three overlapping types: those establishing or symbolizing social cohesion or the membership of groups, real or artificial communities; those establishing or legitimizing institutions, status, or relations of authority; and those whose main purpose was socialization, the inculcation of beliefs, value systems, and conventions of behavior.

## The Difficulty of Applying Traditions Combining Community and Marked Inequality

Larger social entities are not Gemeinschaften or even systems of accepted ranks. Social mobility, class conflict, and prevalent ideology make traditions combining community and marked inequality in formal hierarchies difficult to apply universally. However, general socialization inculcates the same values in every citizen, member of the nation, and subject of the crown, regardless of their status or relations of authority.

## The Influence of Anthropology on Invented Traditions

Anthropology may help to elucidate the differences between invented and old traditional practices. While rites of passage are normally marked in the traditions of particular groups, this was not usually the case in those designed for all-embracing pseudo-communities (nations, countries). However, new traditions tend to be quite unspecific and vague as to the nature of the values, rights, and obligations of the group membership they inculcate.

## The National Flag, the National Anthem, and the National Emblem

[Footnote text]

The National Flag, the National Anthem, and the National Emblem are the three symbols through which an independent country proclaims its identity and sovereignty. They reflect the entire background, thought, and culture of a nation and command instantaneous respect and loyalty.

## Conclusion

The development of Swiss nationalism and the formation of the modern federal state in the nineteenth century was marked by the use of ancient materials to construct invented traditions for novel purposes. While new traditions have not filled more than a small part of the space left by the secular decline of both old tradition and custom, they have played a significant role in shaping national identity and sovereignty.

# The Invention of Tradition: A Study of the Highland Tradition of Scotland

## Introduction

The invention of tradition is a field of study that brings together historians, social anthropologists, and other workers in the human sciences. This book brings together contributions by historians on the invention of tradition, with the hope that others will also find it useful. The concept of a distinct Highland culture and tradition is a retrospective invention, as before the later years of the seventeenth century, the Highlanders of Scotland did not form a distinct people. They were simply the overflow of Ireland.

## The Significance of Tradition in Society

Traditions are important symptoms and indicators of problems that might not otherwise be recognized, and developments which are otherwise difficult to identify and date. They are evidence of the transformation of German nationalism from its old liberal to its new imperialist expansionist pattern, as well as the development of an urban working-class culture in Britain. The study of invented traditions cannot be separated from the wider study of the history of society, nor can it expect to advance much beyond the mere discovery of such practices unless it is integrated into a wider study.

## The Role of Tradition in Modern and Contemporary Historians

Invented traditions are highly relevant to the comparatively recent historical innovation, the 'nation', with its associated phenomena: nationalism, the nation-state, national symbols, histories, and the rest. All these rest on exercises in social engineering which are often deliberate and always innovative, if only because historical novelty implies innovation.

## The Fabrice Syndrome

Participants at the bottom do not usually see historic events they live through as top people or historians do. This phenomenon is known as the 'Fabrice syndrome'.

## The Invention of Tradition and the Highland Tradition of Scotland

Today, whenever Scotchmen gather together to celebrate their national identity, they assert it openly by certain distinctive national apparatus. They wear the kilt, woven in a tartan whose colour and pattern indicates their 'clan'; and if they indulge in music, their instrument is the bagpipe. This apparatus, to which they ascribe great antiquity, is in fact largely modern. It was developed after, sometimes long after, the Union with England against which it is, in a sense, a protest. Before the Union, it did indeed exist in vestigial form; but that form was regarded by the large majority of Scotchmen as a sign of barbarism: the badge of roguish, idle, predatory, blackmailing Highlanders who were more of a nuisance than a threat to civilized, historic Scotland. Even in the Highlands, even in that vestigial form, it was relatively new: it was not the original, or the distinguishing badge of Highland society.

## The Interdisciplinary Nature of Tradition Study

The study of the invention of tradition is interdisciplinary, bringing together historians, social anthropologists, and a variety of other workers in the human sciences. This book brings together contributions by historians on the invention of tradition, with the hope that others will also find it useful.
