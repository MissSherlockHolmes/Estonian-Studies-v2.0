### Cultural Roots

No more arresting emblems of the modern culture of nationalism exist than cenotaphs and tombs of Unknown Soldiers. The public ceremonial reverence accorded these monuments, precisely because they are either deliberately empty or no one knows who lies inside them, has no true precedents in earlier times. To feel the force of this modernity, one has only to imagine the general reaction to the body who discovered the Unknown Soldier's name or insisted on filling the cenotaph with some real bones. Sacrilege of a strange, contemporary kind! Yet, as these tombs are of identical mortal remains or immortal souls, they are nonetheless saturated with ghostly national imaginings. This is why so many different nations have such tombs without feeling any need to specify the nationality of their absent occupants. What else could they be but Germans, Americans, Argentinians?

The cultural significance of such monuments becomes even clearer if one tries to imagine, say, a Tomb of the Unknown Marxist or a cenotaph for fallen Liberals. Is a sense of absurdity available? The reason is that neither Marxism nor Liberalism are much concerned with death and immortality. If the nationalist imagining is so concerned, this suggests a strong affinity with religious imaginings. As this affinity is by no means fortuitous, it may be useful to begin a consideration of the cultural roots of nationalism with death, as the last of a whole gamut of fatalities.

If the manner of a man's dying usually seems arbitrary, his mortality is inescapable. Human lives are full of such combinations of necessity and chance. We are all aware of the contingency and ineluctability of our particular genetic heritage, our gender, our life era, our physical capabilities, our mother tongue, and so forth. The great merit of traditional religious worldviews (which naturally must be distinguished from their role in the legitimation of specific systems of domination and exploitation) has been their concern with man-in-the-cosmos, man as species being, and the continuity of life. The extraordinary survival over thousands of years of Buddhism, Christianity, or Islam in dozens of different social formations attests to their imaginative response to the overwhelming burden of human sufferingâ€”disease, mutilation, grief, age, and death. Why was I born blind? Why is my best friend paralyzed? Why is my daughter retarded? The religions attempt to explain. The great weakness of all evolutionary/progressive styles of thought, not excluding Marxism, is that such questions are answered with impatient silence.

Cf. Regis Debray, "Marxism and the National Question," *New Left Review*, 105 (September-October 1977), p. 29. In the course of doing fieldwork in Indonesia in the 1960s, I was struck by the calm refusal of many Muslims to accept the ideas of Darwin. At first, I interpreted this refusal as obscurantism. Subsequently, I came to see it as an honest attempt to be consistent: the doctrine of evolution is simply not compatible with the teachings of Islam. What are we to make of a scientific...

At the same time, in different ways, religious thought also responds to obscure intimations of immortality, generally by transforming fatality into continuity (karma, original sin, etc.). In this way, it concerns itself with the links between the dead and the yet-unborn.

## The Mystery of Regeneration

Who experiences their child's conception and birth without dimly apprehending a combined interconnectedness, fortuity, and fatality in a language of 'continuity'? (Again, the disadvantage of evolutionary/progressive thought is an insufficient treatment here; to any degree of secularism.)

I bring up these perhaps simplified observations primarily because in Western Europe the eighteenth century marks not only the dawn of the age of nationalism but the dusk of religious modes of thought. The culture of the Enlightenment of rationalist secularism brought with it its own modern darkness. With the ebbing of religious belief, the suffering which belief in part composed did not disappear. Disintegration of paradise: nothing makes fatality more arbitrary. Absurdity of salvation: nothing makes another style of continuity more necessary. What then was required was a secular transformation of fatality into continuity, contingency into meaning. As we shall see, few things were (are) better suited to this end than an idea of nation. In nation-states, which are widely conceded to be 'lived and historical,' the nations to which they give political expression always loom out of an immemorial past; and, still more important, materialism, which formally accepts the findings of physics about matter, yet makes so little effort to link these findings with the class struggle, revolution, or whatever. Does not the abyss between protons and the proletariat conceptualize an unacknowledged metaphysical conception of man? But see the refreshing texts of Jacostiano Timpanaro, *On Materialism* and *The Freudian Slip*, and Raymond Williams' thoughtful response to them in "Timpanaro's Materialist Challenge," *New Left Review*, 109 (May-June 1978), pp. 3-17.

The late President Sukarno always spoke with complete sincerity of the 350 years of colonialism that his 'Indonesia' had endured, although the very concept 'Indonesia' is a twentieth-century invention, and most of today's Indonesia was only conquered by the Dutch between 1850 and 1910. Presentiment among contemporary Indonesia's national heroes is the early thirteenth-century Javanese Prince Diponegoro, although the Prince's own memoirs show that he intended to 'conquer [not liberate] Java' rather than expel the Dutch. Indeed, he clearly had no concept of 'the Dutch' as a civilization. See Harry J. Benda and John A. Larkin (eds.), *The World of Southeast Asia*, 1958; and Ann Kumar, "Diponegoro (1778-1855)," *India'sa*.

## Imagined Communities

Glide into a limitless future. It is the magic of nationalism to turn chance into destiny. With Debray we might say, "Yes, it is quite accidental that I am born French; but after all, France is eternal."

Needless to say, I am not claiming that the appearance of nationalism towards the end of the eighteenth century was induced by the erosion of religious certainties, or that this erosion does not itself require a complex explanation. Nor am I suggesting that somehow nationalism historically 'supersedes' religion. What I am proposing is that nationalism has to be understood by aligning it, not with self-consciously held political ideologies, but with the large cultural systems that preceded it, out of which - as well as against which - it came into being.

For present purposes, the two relevant cultural systems are the religious community and the dynastic realm. For both of these, in their heydays, were taken-for-granted frames of reference, very much as nationality is today. It is therefore essential to consider what gave these cultural systems their self-evident plausibility, and at the same time to underline certain key elements in their decomposition.

### The Religious Community

Few things are more impressive than the vast territorial stretch of the Islamic Ummah from Morocco to the Sulu Archipelago, or Christianity from Paraguay to Japan, and of the Buddhist world from Sri Lanka to the Korean peninsula. The great sacral cultures (and for our purposes here it may be permissible to include Confucianism) incorporated conceptions of immense communities. But Christendom, the Islamic Ummah, and even the Middle Kingdom - which, though we think of it today as Chinese, imagined itself not as Chinese, but as central - were imaginable largely through the medium of a sacred language and written script.

Take only the example of Islam: if Maguindanao met Berbers in Mecca, knowing nothing of each other's languages, incapable of communicating orally, they nonetheless understood each other's ideographs, because the sacred texts they shared existed only in classical Arabic. In this sense, when Arabic functioned like Chinese characters to create a community out of signs, not sounds. (So today mathematical language continues an old tradition: see what the Romans did to the Picta, and vice versa, but both comprehend the symbol.) All the great classical communities conceived of themselves as cosmically central through the medium of a sacred language linked to a superterrestrial order of power. 

Accordingly, the stretch of written Latin, Pali, Arabic, or...

## Chinese was, in theory, unlimited. 

(In fact, the deader the written languageâ€”the farther it was from speechâ€”the betterâ€”in principle everyone has access to a pure world of signs.)

### Yet such classical communities linked by sacred languages had a character distinct from the imagined communities of modern nations.

One crucial difference was the older communities' confidence in the unique sacredness of their languages, and thus their ideas about admission to meritocracy. Chinese mandarins looked with approval on barbarians who painfully learned to paint Middle Kingdom ideograms. These barbarians were already halfway to full absorption. Half-civilized was vastly better than barbarian. Such an attitude was certainly not peculiar to the Chinese, nor confined to antiquity. 

Consider, for example, the following 'policy on barbarians' formulated by the early nineteenth-century Colombian liberal Pedro Fermin de Vargas:

To expand our agriculture it would be necessary to hispanicize our Indians. Their idleness, stupidity, and indifference towards normal endeavours cause one to think that they come from a degenerate race which deteriorates in proportion to the distance from its origin ... it would be very desirable that the Indians be extinguished by miscegenation with the whites, declaring them free of tribute and other charges, and giving them private property in land.

How striking it is that this liberal still proposes to 'extinguish' his Indians in part by 'declaring them free of tribute' and 'giving them private property in land', rather than exterminating them or gun and microbe as his heirs in Brazil, Argentina, and the United States began to do soon afterwards. Note also, alongside the condescending cruelty, a cosmic optimism: the Indian is affirmedly 'redeemed' by impregnation with white, 'civilized' semen, and the acquisition of private property, like everyone else. 

(How different Ferrari's attitude is from the later European imperialist's preference for 'genuine' Malays, Gurkhas, and Hausas over 'half-breeds,' 'semi-educated natives,' 'wogs', and the like.)

Yet if the sacred silent languages were the media through which the great global communities of the past were imagined, the reality of such apparitions depended on an idea largely foreign to the contemporary Western mind: the non-arbitrariness of the sign. The ideograms of Chinese, Latin, or Arabic were emanations of reality, not random fabricated representations of it. 

We are familiar with the long dispute over the appropriate language (Latin or vernacular) for the mass. In the Islamic tradition, until quite recently, the Qur'an was literally untranslatable (and therefore untranslated), because Allah's truth was accessible only through the unsubstitutable true signs of written Arabic. There is no idea here of a world so separated from language that all languages are equidistant (and thus interchangeable) signs for it. In effect, ontological reality is apprehensible only through a single, privileged system of re-presentation: the truth-language of Church Latin, Qur'anic Arabic, or Examination Chinese. 

And, as truth-languages, imbued with an impulse largely foreign to nationalism, the impulse towards conversion. By conversion, I mean not so much the acceptance of particular religious tenets, but alchemic absorption. The barbarian becomes Middle Kingdom, the Rif Muslim, the longo Christian. The whole nature of man's being is sacrally malleable. 

(Contrast thus the prestige of these old world-languages, however high over all vernaculars, with Esperanto or VolapÃ¼k, which lie ignored between them.) It was, after all, this possibility of conversion through the sacred language that made it possible for an 'Enlightenment' to become Romani and a 'Muslim' Son of Heaven.

But even though the sacred languages made such communities as Christendom recognizable, the actual scope and plausibility of these communities cannot be explained by sacred script alone; their readers were, after all, tiny literate reefs on top of vast illiterate oceans. A fuller explanation requires a glance at the relationship between the literati and their societies. 

It would be a mistake to view the former as a kind of theological technocracy. The languages they sustained, if abstruse, had none of the self-arranged abstraction of lawyers' or economists' jargons, on the margin of society's idea of reality. Rather, the literati were adepts, strategic strata in a cosmological hierarchy of which the apex was divine. The fundamental conceptions about 'social groups' were centripetal and hierarchical, rather than boundary-oriented and horizontal. 

The astonishing power of the papacy in its noonday is only comprehensible in terms of a trans-European Latin-writing clerisy, and a conception of the world, shared by virtually everyone, that the bilingual intelligentsia, by mediating between vernacular and Latin, mediated between earth and heaven. 

(The awesomeness of excommunication reflects this cosmology.) 

Yet for all the grandeur and power of the great religiously...

## Imagined Communities

The unselfconscious coherence of imagined communities waned steadily after the late Middle Ages. Among the reasons for this decline, I wish here to emphasize only the two that are directly related to these communities' unique sacredness.

### First Effect: Exploration of the Non-European World

The first was the effect of the explorations of the non-European world, which mainly, but by no means exclusively, widened the cultural and geographic horizon and hence also men's conception of possible forms of human life[^1]. The process is already apparent in the greatest of all European travel books. Consider the following vivid description of Kublai Khan by the good Venetian Christian Marco Polo at the end of the thirteenth century:

"The grand khan, having obtained this signal victory, returned with great pomp and triumph to the capital city of Kanbalu. This took place in the month of November, and he continued to reside there during the months of February and March, in which later was our festival of Easter. Being aware that this was one of our principal solemnities, he commanded all the Christians to attend him, and to bring with them their Book, which contains the four Gospels of the Evangelium. After ceasing it to be repeatedly perfumed with incense, in a ceremonious manner, he devoutly kissed it, and directed that the same should be done by all the nobles who were present. This was his usual practice upon each of the principal Christian festivals, such as Easter and Christmas; and he observed the same at the festivals of the Saracens, Jews, and idolaters. Upon being asked his motive for this conduct, he said: 'There are four great Prophets who are reverenced and worshipped by the different classes of mankind. The Christians regard Jesus Christ as their divinity; the Saracens, Mahomet; the Jews, Moses; and the idolaters, Sogomobar-kan, the most eminent among their idols. I do honour and show respect to all the four, and invoke to my aid whichever amongst them is in truth supreme in heaven.'" 

But from the manner in which his majesty acted towards them, it is evident that he regarded the faith of the Christians as the truest and the best. What is so remarkable about this passage is not so much the great Mongol dynasty's calm religious relativism (it is still a religious relativism), as Marco Polo's attitude and language. It never comes to him, even though he is writing for fellow-European Christians, to term Kublai a hypocrite or an idolater. (No doubt in part because "in respect to number of subjects, extent of territory, and amount of revenue, he surpasses every sovereign that has heretofore been or now is in the world.")[^2]. 

In the unselfconscious use of "our" (which becomes "theirs") and the description of the faith of the Christians as "truest," rather than "true," we can detect the seeds of a territorialization of faith which foreshadows the language of many nationalists ("our" nation is "the best" - in a competitive, comparative field).

### Contrast with Eighteenth-Century Perspectives

What a revealing contrast is provided by the opening of the letter written by the Persian traveller Rica to his friend Ibben from Paris in 1712:

"The Pope is the chief of the Christians; he is an ancient idol, worshipped now from habit. Once he was formidable even to princes, for he would defeat them as easily as our magnificent sultans defeat the kings of Imemetia or Georgia. But nobody fears him any longer. He claims to be the successor of one of the earliest Christians, called Saint Peter, and it is certainly a rich succession for his tremendous name, and he has a great country under his control."

The deliberate sophisticated fabrications of the eighteenth-century Catholic mirror the naive realism of his thirteenth-century predecessor, but by now the "relativization" and "territorialization" are utterly self-conscious and political in intent. Is it unreasonable to see a paradoxical elaboration of this evolving tradition in Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's identification of The Great Satan, not as a heresy, nor even as a demonic personage, but as a nation?

### Second Effect: Demotion of the Sacred Language

The second was a gradual demotion of the sacred language itself. Writing of medieval Western Europe, Bloch noted that Latin was not only the language in which teaching was done; it was the only language taught. (This second "only" shows quite clearly the sacredness of Latin - no other language was thought worth teaching.) But by the sixteenth century, all this was changing fast. The reasons for the change need not deter us here; the continued use of print capitalism will be discussed below. It is sufficient to remind ourselves of its scale and pace. Febvre and Martin estimate that 77% of the books printed before 1500 were still in Latin (meaning nonetheless that 23% were already in vernaculars). If of the 88 editions printed in Paris in 1501, all but 8 were in Latin, after 1575 a majority were always in French[^3]. Despite a temporary comeback during the Counter-Reformation, Latin's hegemony was doomed. Nor are we speaking simply of a general popularity. Somewhat later, but at no less dizzying speed, Latin ceased to be the language of a pan-European high intelligentsia. In the seventeenth century, Hobbes (1588-1678) was a figure of continental renown because he wrote in the truth-language. Shakespeare (1564-1616), on the other hand...

[^3]: Henri de Montaigne, *Persian Letters*, p. 81. The *Lettres Persanes* first appeared in 1721.

## Composing in the Vernacular

Composing in the vernacular was virtually unknown across the Channel. And had English not become, two hundred years later, the pre-eminent world imperial language, might he not largely have retained his original insular obscurity? Meanwhile, these men's cross-Channel near-contemporaries, Descartes (1596-1650) and Pascal (1623-1662), conducted most of their correspondence in Latin; but virtually all of Voltaire's (1694-1778) was in the vernacular. 

After 1640, with fewer and fewer books coming out in Latin, and more and more in the vernacular languages, publishing was ceasing to be an international enterprise[^1]. In a word, the fall of Latin exemplified a larger process in which the sacred communities integrated by old sacred languages were gradually fragmented, pluralized, and territorialized.

## The Dynastic Realm

These days it is perhaps difficult to put oneself critically into a world in which the dynastic realm appeared for most men as the only imaginable political system. For in fundamental ways, serious monarchy lies transverse to all modern conceptions of political life. Kingship organizes everything around a high centre. Its legitimacy derives from liveliness, not from populations, who, after all, are subjects, not citizens. 

In the modern conception, state sovereignty is fully, flatly, and evenly operative over each square centimetre of a legally demarcated territory. But in the older imagining, where states were defined by centres, borders were porous and indistinct, and sovereignties faded imperceptibly into one another. Hence, paradoxically enough, the ease with which pre-modern empires and kingdoms were able to sustain their rule over immensely heterogeneous, and often not even contiguous, populations for long periods of time[^2].

Notice that displacement in rulers' nomenclature corresponds to this transformation. Schoolchildren remember monarchs by their first names (what was William the Conqueror's surname?), presidents by their last (what was Ebert's Christian name?). In a world of citizens, all of whom are theoretically eligible for the presidency, the limited pool of 'Christian' names makes them inadequate as specifying designators. In monarchies, however, where rule is reserved for a single surname, it is necessarily Christian names, with numbers, or sobriquets, that supply the requisite distinctions[^3].

We may here note in passing that Naimi is certainly correct in describing the 1707 Act of Union between England and Scotland as a 'patrician bargain,' in the sense that the union's architects were aristocratic politicians. (See his lucid discussion in *The Break-up of Britain*, p. 136f.) Still, it is difficult to imagine such a bargain being made.

## Imagined Communities

One must also remember that these antique monarchical states expanded not only by warfare but by sexual politicsâ€”of a kind very different from that practiced today. Through the general principle of verticality, dynastic marriages brought together diverse populations under new cretes. Paradigmatic in this respect was the House of Habsburg. As the tag went, *Bella gerant ali tu felix Austria nulli*. Here, in somewhat abbreviated form, is the later dynasts' title nature[^4]: 

Emperor of Austria; King of Hungary, of Bulgaria, of Dalmatia, Croatia, Slavonia, Galicia, Lodomeria, and Illyria; King of Jerusalem, etc.; Archduke of Austria; Grand Duke of Tuscany and Cracow; Duke of Lotharingia, of Salzburg, Styria, Carinthia, Carniola, and Bukovina; Grand Duke of Transylvania; Margrave of Moravia; Duke of Upper and Lower Silesia, of Modena, Parma, Piacenza, and Guastalla, of Auschwitz and Sator, of Teschen, Friuli, Ragusa, and Zara; Princely Count of Habsburg and Tyrol, of Kyburg, GÃ¶rz, and Gradiska; Duke of Trient and Brizen; Margrave of Upper and Lower Lausitz and in Istria; Count of Hohenems, Feldkirch, Bregenz, Sonnenberg, etc.; Lord of Trieste, of Cattaro, and above the Windisch Mark; Great Voivod of the Vojvodina, Servia, etc.

This, Jaszi aptly observes, was 'not without a certain comic aspect', the record of the innumerable marriages, hicksterings, and captures of the Habsburgs.

In realms where polygyny was religiously sanctioned, complex systems of tiered concubinage were essential to the integration of the realm. In fact, royal lineages often derived their prestige, aside from any aura of divinity, from, shall we say, miscegenation[^5]. For such struck between the aristocracies of two republics. The conception of a United Kingdom was surely the crucial mediating element that made the deal possible.

### Mixtures and Dynasties

Mixtures were signs of a superordinate status. It is characteristic that there has not been an 'English' dynasty ruling in London since the eleventh century (if then), and what 'nationality' are we to assign to the Bourbons? 

During the seventeenth century, howeverâ€”for reasons that need not detain us hereâ€”the automatic legitimacy of sacral monarchy began its slow decline in Western Europe. In 1649, Charles Stuart was beheaded in the first of the modern world's revolutions, and during the 1650s one of the more important European states was ruled by a plebeian Protector rather than a king. Yet even in the age of Pope and Addison, Anne Stuart was still healing the sick by the laying on of royal hats; cures committed also by the Bourbons, in this XV and XVI, in Enlightened France till the end of the ancient regime. 

But after 1789, the principle of Legitimacy had to be loudly and self-consciously defended, and, in the process, monarchy became a semi-standardized model. Tenno and Son of Heaven became 'Emperors'. In far-off Siam, Rama V (Chulalongkorn) sent his sons and nephews to the courts of St. Petersburg, London, and Berlin to learn the intricacies of the world model. In 1887, he instituted the requisite principle of succession by legal primogeniture, thus bringing Siam into line with the 'civilized' monarchies of Europe. The new system brought to the throne in 1910 an erratic homosexual who would certainly have been passed over in an earlier age. However, inter-monarchic approval of his ascension as Rama VI was sealed by the attendance at his coronation of princelings from Britain, Russia, Greece, Sweden, Denmarkâ€”and Japan.

The reaction to the news of his erratic heir-apparent's murder: "In this manner superior power has restored that order which unfortunately was unable to maintain" (ibid., p. 125).

## Imagined Communities

As late as 1914, dynastic states made up the majority of the membership of the world political system, but, as we shall be noting in detail below, many dynasts had for some time been reaching for a 'national' cachet as the old principle of Legitimacy withered silently away. While the armies of Frederick the Great (r. 1740-1786) were heavily staffed by 'foreigners', those of his great-nephew Friedrich Wilhelm III (r. 1797-1840) were, as a result of Scharnhorst's, Gneisenau's, and Clausewitz's spectacular reforms, exclusively national Protestants.

### Apprehensions of Time

It would be short-sighted, however, to think of the imagined communities of nations as simply growing out of and replacing religious communities and dynastic realms. Beneath the decline of sacred communities, languages, and lineages, a fundamental change was taking place in modes of apprehending the world, which, more than anything else, made it possible to 'think' the nation. 

To get a feeling for this change, one can profitably turn to the visual representations of the sacred communities, such as the reliefs and stained-glass windows of medieval churches, or the paintings of early Italian and Flemish masters. A characteristic feature of such representations is something misleadingly analogous to 'modern dress'. The shepherds who have followed the star to the manger where Christ is born bear the features of Burgundian peasants. The Virgin Mary is figured as a Tuscan merchant's daughter. In many paintings, the commissioning patron, in full burgher or noble costume, appears kneeling in adoration alongside the shepherds. What seems incongruous today obviously appeared wholly natural to the eyes of medieval worshippers. 

We are faced with a world in which the figuring of imagined reality was overwhelmingly visual and aural. Christendom assumed its universal form through a myriad of specificities and particularities: this relief, that window, this sermon, that tale, this morality play, that relic. While the trans-European Latin-reading clerisy was one essential element in the structuring of the Christian imagination, the mediation of its conceptions to the illiterate masses, by visual and aural creations, always personal and particular, was no less vital. The humble parish priest, whose forehead and frailties everyone who heard his celebrations knew, was still the direct intermediary between his parishioners and the divine. This juxtaposition of the cosmic-universal and the mundane-particular meant that however vast Christendom might be, and was sensed to be, it manifested itself variously to particular Swabian or Andalusian communities as replications of themselves.

## Features or 'First-Century' Costumes in the Restoring Spirit of the Modern Museum

The modern museum was unimaginable because the medieval Christian mind had no conception of history as an endless chain of cause and effect or of radical separations between past and present. Bloch observes that people thought they must be near the end of time, in the sense that the coming of Christendom could occur at any moment. Paul had said that "the day of the Lord cometh like a thief in the night." It was thus natural for the great twelfth-century chronicler Bishop Otto of Freising to refer repeatedly to "we who have been placed at the end of time." Bloch concludes that as soon as medieval men gave themselves up to meditation, nothing was farther from their thoughts than the prospect of a long future for a young and vigorous human race.

Auerbach gives an unforgettable sketch of this form of consciousness:

> For us, the idea of 'modern dress,' a metaphorical equivalencing of past with present, is a backhanded recognition of their fatal separation.

## Imagined Communities

If an occurrence like the sacrifice of Isaac is interpreted as prefiguring the sacrifice of Christ, so that in the former the latter is "as it were announced and promised" and the latter "fulfills" the former, then a connection is established between two events which are linked neither temporally nor causallyâ€”a connection which it is impossible to establish by reason in the horizontal dimension. It can be established only if both occurrences are vertically linked to Divine Providence, which alone is able to devise such a plan of history and supply the key to its understanding. The here and now is no longer a mere link in an earthly chain of events; it is simultaneously something that has always been and will be fulfilled in the future; and strictly, in the eyes of God, it is something eternal, something omnitemporal, something already consummated in the realm of fragmentary earthly events.

He rightly stresses that such an idea of simultaneity is wholly alien to our own. It views time as something close to what Benjamin calls Messianic time, a simultaneity of past and future in an instantaneous present. In such a view of things, the word "meanwhile" cannot be of real significance.

Our own conception of simultaneity has been a long time in the making, and its emergence is certainly connected in ways that have yet to be well studied with the development of the secular sciences. But it is a conception of such fundamental importance that, without taking it fully into account, we will find it difficult to probe all obscure generations of nationalism. What has come to take the place of the medieval conception of simultaneityâ€”a long timeâ€”is, to borrow again from Benjamin, an idea of "homogeneous, empty time," in which simultaneity is, as it were, transverse, cross-time, marked not by prefiguring and fulfillment, but by temporal coincidence, and measured by clock and calendar.

Why this transformation should be so important for the birth of the imagined community of the nation can best be seen if we consider the basic structure of two forms of imagining which first flowered in the eighteenth century: the novel and the newspaper. For these forms provided the technical means for re-presenting the kind of imagined community that is the nation.

Consider first the structure of the old-fashioned novel, a structure typical not only of the masterpieces of Balzac but also of any contemporary orthodox. It is clearly a device for the preservation of simultaneity in "homogeneous, empty time," or a complex gloss upon the word "meanwhile." Take, for illustrative purposes, a segment of a simple novel plot, in which a man (A) has a wife (B) and a mistress (C), who in turn has a lover (D). We might imagine a sort of time-chart for this segment as follows:

Notice that during this sequence A and D never meet; indeed, they may not even be aware of each other's existence if C has played her cards right. What theoretically links A to D? Two complementary conceptions: First, that they are embedded in societies (e.g., Wessex, LÃ¼beck, Los Angeles). These societies are sociological entities of such firm and stable reality that their members (A and D) can even be described as passing each other on the street, without ever becoming acquainted, and still be connected. Second, that A and D are...

## Polyphony in the Modern Novel

This polyphony decisively marks off the modern novel even from its brilliant forerunner, Petronius's *Satyricon*. Its narrative proceeds single file. If Incolpius bewails his young lover's athlessness, we are not simultaneously shown Grotius and Ascylus.

### Imagined Communities

Embedded in the minds of the omniscient readers, only they, like God, watch A telephoning C, B shopping, and D playing pool all at once. That all these acts are performed at the same clocked, calendrical time, but by actors who may be largely unaware of one another, shows the novelty of this imagined world conjured up by the author in his readers' minds.

The idea of a sociological organism moving calendrically through homogeneous empty time is a precise analogue of the idea of the nation, which is also conceived as a solid community moving steadily down (or up) history. An American will never meet or even know the names of more than a handful of his 240,000-odd fellow Americans. He has no idea of what they are up to at any one time. But he has complete confidence in their steady, anonymous simultaneous activity.

The perspective I am suggesting will perhaps seem less abstract if we turn to inspect briefly four fictions from different cultures and different epochs, all but one of which, nonetheless, are inextricably bound to nationalist movements. In 1887, the Father of Filipino Nationalism, Jose Rizal, wrote the novel *Noli Me Tangere*, which today is regarded as the greatest achievement of modern Filipino literature. It was also almost the first novel written by an Indian.

Here is how it marvelously begins:

Toward the end of October, Don Santiago de los Santos, popularly known as Capitan Tiago, was giving a dinner party. Although, 

In this context, it is rewarding to compare any historical novel with documents or narratives from the period fictionalized.

Nothing better shows the immersion of the novel in homogeneous, empty time than the absence of those prefatory genealogies, often ascending to the origin of man, which are so characteristic a feature of ancient chronicles, legends, and holy books.

Rizal wrote this novel in the colonial language (Spanish), which was then the lingua franca of the ethnically diverse Eurasian and native elites. Alongside the novel appeared also for the first time a 'nationalist' press, not only in Spanish but in such 'ethnic' languages as Tagalog and Ilocano. See Leopoldo Y. Yates, "The Modern Literature of the Philippines," pp. 287-302, in Pierre-Bernard Rafont and Denys Lombard (eds), *LittÃ©ratures Contemporaines de l'Asie du Sud-Est*.

## Cultural Roots

Contrary to his usual practice, he had announced it only that afternoon; it was already the subject of every conversation in Binondo, in other quarters of the city, and even in the walled inner city of Intramuros. In those days, Capitan Tiago had the reputation of a lavish host. It was known that his house, like his country, closed its doors to nothing except to commerce and to any new or daring act.

So the news coursed like an electric shock through the community of parasites, spongers, and gatecrashers whom God, in His infinite goodness, created, and so tenderly multiplies in Manila. Some lunned pound for their boots; others looked for collar-buttons and cavats. But one and all were preoccupied with the problem of how to greet their host with the familiarity required to create the appearance of longstanding friendship, or, if need be, to excuse themselves for not having arrived earlier.

The dinner was being given at a house on Anlogague Street. Since we do not recall the street number, we shall describe it in such a way that it may still be recognizedâ€”that is, if earthquakes have not yet destroyed it. We do not believe that its owner will have had it torn down, since such work is usually left to God or to Nature, which, besides, holds many contracts with our Government.

Extensive comment is surely unnecessary. It should suffice to note that right from the start, the image (wholly new to Filipino writers) of a dinner party being discussed by hundreds of unnamed people, who do not know each other, in quite different parts of Manila, in a particular month of a particular decade, immediately conjures up the imagined community. 

In the phrase "a house on Anlogague Street," which we shall describe in such a way that it may still be recognized, the would-be prognizers are weâ€”Filipino readers. The casual progression of this house from the 'interior' time of the novel to the 'exterior' time of the [Manila] reader's everyday life gives a hypnotic confirmation of the solidity of a single community, embracing characters, author, and readers, moving onward through calendrical time.

Notice too the tone. While Rizal has not the faintest idea of his readers' individual identities, he writes to them with an ironic touch.

## Intimacy

As though their relationships with each other are not in the smallest degree problematic. Nothing gives one a more Foucauldian sense of abrupt discontinues or consciousness than to compare *Noli* with the most celebrated previous literary work by an 'Indio', Franzisko Balagtas (Baltazar's *Pinagdaanang Buhay ni Florante at ni Laura sa Kahariang Albania* [The Story of Florante and Laura in the Kingdom of Albania]). The first printed edition of which dates from 1838. For although Balagtas was still alive when Rizal was born, the world of his masterpiece is in every basic respect foreign to that of *Noli*. Its settingâ€”a fabulous medieval Albaniaâ€”is utterly removed in time and space from the Binondo of the 1880s. Its heroesâ€”Florante, a Christian Albanian nobleman, and his bosom friend Aladin, a Muslim ('Moro') Persian aristocratâ€”remind us of the Philippines only by the Christian-Moro linkage. Where Rizal deliberately sprinkles his Spanish prose with Tagalog words for 'realistic', satirical, or nationalist effect, Balagtas unselfconsciously mixes Spanish phrases into his Tagalog quatrains simply to heighten the grandeur and sonority of his diction. *Noli* was meant to be read, while *Florante at Laura* was to be sung aloud. 

Most striking of all is Balagtas's handling of time. As Lumbera notes, the unraveling of the plot does not follow a chronological order. The story begins in medias res, so that the complete story comes through a series of speeches that serve as flashbacks. Almost half of the 399 quatrains are accounts of Florante's childhood, student years in Athens, and subsequent military exploits, given by the hero in conversation with a sense of 'created' (vio) to the all-of-us-together present tense of 'multiples'[^1]. 

The obverse side of the readers' anonymous obscurity was/is the author's immediate celebrity. As we shall see, this obscurity/celebrity has everything to do with the spread of print capitalism. As early as 1593, energetic Dominicans had published in Manila the *Docrina Christiana*. But for centuries thereafter, print remained under tight ecclesiastical control. Liberalization only began in the 1860s. See Biervenido L. Lumbera, *Tagalog Poetry 1570-1898, Tradition and Influences in its Development*, pp. 35, 93.

## Cultural Roots

The 'spoken flashback' was for Balagtas the only alternative to a straightforward single-file narrative. If we learn of Florante's and Aladin's simultaneous pasts, they are connected by their conversing voices, not by the structure of the epic. How distant this technique is from that of the novel: "In that same spring, while Florante was still studying in Athens, Aladin was expelled from his sovereign's court ... In effect, it never occurs to Balagtas to situate his protagonist in society," or to discuss them with his audience. Nor, aside from the multifluous flow of Tagalog polyphrably, is there much 'Filipino' about his text[^2].

In 1816, seventy years before the writing of *Noli*, JosÃ© Joaquin Fernandez de Luzardi wrote a novel called *El Periquillo Santiago* (The Itching Parrot), evidently the first Latin American work in this genre. In the words of one critic, this text is a ferocious indication of Spanish administration in Mexico: ignorance, superstition, and corruption are seen to be its most notable characteristics[^3]. The essential form of this 'nationalist' novel is indicated by the following description of its content:

"From the first, [the hero, the Itching Parrot] is exposed to bad influencesâ€”ignorance maids inculcate superstitions, his mother indulges his whims, his teachers either have no vocation or no ability." 

This famous stanza has sometimes been interpreted as a veiled statement of Filipino patriotism, but Lumbera convincingly shows such an interpretation to be an anachronistic gloss. *Tagalog Poetry*, p. 125. The translation is Lumbera's. I have slightly altered his Tagalog text to conform to a 1973 edition of the poem based on the 1861 imprint[^4].

## Fixity that Fuses the World Inside the Novel with the World Outside

### This picturesque tour d'honorisâ€”hospitals, prisons, remote villages, monasteries, Indians, Negroesâ€”is nonetheless not a tour du monde. The horizon is clearly bounded: it is that of colonial Mexico. Nothing assures us of this sociological solidity more than the succession of pluralis. To conjure up a social space full of complex prisons, none in itself of any unique importance, but all representative (in their singular, separate existence) of the oppressiveness of this colony's prisons. Contrary prisons in the Bible are never imagined as typical of this or that society. Each, like the one where Salome was bewitched by John the Baptist, is magically alone.

Finally, to remove the possibility that, since Rizal and Lizardi both wrote in Spanish, the frameworks we have been studying are 'somehow' European, here is the opening of *Semarang Hitam* (Black Semarang), a tale by the ill-fated young Indonesian communist-nationalist Mas Marco Kartodikromo, published serially in 1924. This movement of a solitary hero through an adamantine social landscape is typical of many early (anti-)colonial novels.

After a brief, meteoric career as a radical journalist, Marco was interned by the Dutch colonial authorities in Boven Digul, one of the world's earliest concentration camps, deep in the interior swamps of western Netherlands. There he died in 1932, after six years of confinement. Henri Chambert-Louis, Mas Marco[^1].

## Cultural Roots

It was 7 o'clock Saturday evening; young people in Semarang never stayed at home on Saturday night. On this night, however, nobody was about. The heavy day-long rain had made the roads wet and very slippery, so all had stayed at home.

For the workers in shops and offices, Saturday morning was a time of anticipationâ€”enjoying their leisure and the fun of walking around the city in the evening. But on this night, they were too disappointedâ€”because of lethargy caused by the bad weather and the sticky roads in the kampungs. The main roads, usually crammed with an order of traffic, and the footpaths, usually teeming with people, were all deserted. Now and then, the crack of a horse-cab's whip could be heard spurring a horse on its wayâ€”or the clip-clop of horses' hooves pulling carriages along.

Semarang was deserted. The light from the rows of gas lamps shone straight down on the shining asphalt road. Occasionally, the clear light from the gas lamps was dimmed as the wind blew from the east.

A young man was seated on a long rattan lounge, reading a newspaper. He was totally engrossed. His occasional anger and, at other times, smiles were a sure sign of his deep interest in the story. He turned the pages of the newspaper, thinking that perhaps he could find something that would stop him from feeling so miserable. All of a sudden, he came upon an article entitled:

### Prosperity

A destitute vagrant became ill and died on the side of the road from exposure.

The young man was moved by this brief report. He could just imagine the suffering of the poor soul as he lay dying on the side of the road. One moment he felt an explosive anger well up inside. Another moment he felt pity. Yet another moment his anger was directed at the social system which gave rise to such poverty while making a small group of people wealthy.

Here, as in *El Periquillo Sarmiento*, we are in a world of plurals: shops, offices, carriages, kampungs, and gas lamps. As in the case of *Noli*, weâ€”the Irdo-man-readersâ€”are plunged immediately into a surreal time and a familiar landscape; some of us may well have walked those 'sticky' Semarang roads. Once again, a solitary hero is juxtaposed to a socioscape described in careful, general detail. But there is also something new: a hero who is never named, but who is frequently referred to as 'our young man.' Precisely the clumsiness and literary naivety of the text confirm the unselfconscious sincerity of this pronominal adjective. Neither Marco nor his readers have any doubts about the reference. If in the jocular-sophisticated fiction of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Europe the trope 'our hero' merely underlines an authorial play with a(ny) reader, Marco's 'our young man,' not least in its novelty, means a young man who belongs to the collective body of readers of Indonesian, and thus implicitly, an embryonic Indonesian 'imagined community.' Notice that Marco feels no need to specify this community by name: it is already there. Even if political Dutch colonial censors could join his leadership, they are excluded from this 'ourness,' as can be seen from the fact that the young man's anger is directed at 'the,' not 'our,' social system.

Finally, the imagined community is confirmed by the doubleness of our reading about our young man reading. He does not find the corpse of the destitute vagrant by the side of a sticky Semarang road, but imagines it from the print in a newspaper. Nor does he care the slightest if the dead vagrant was an individual; he thinks of the representative body, not the personal life.

It is fitting that in *Semarang Hitam* a newspaper appears embedded[^2].

## 53. In 1924, a close friend and political ally of Marco published a novel titled *Rasa Merdika* [Feling Free/The Feel of Freedom]. Of the hero of this novel (which he wrongly attributes to Marco), Chambert-Loir writes that "he has no idea of the meaning of the word 'socialism'; nonetheless, he feels a profound malaise in the face of the social organization that surrounds him and he feels the need to enlarge his horizons by travel methods: travel and reading." (Mas Marco, p. 208. Emphasis added.) The itching horizon has moved to Java and the twentieth century.

## CULTURAL ROOTS

In fiction, for if we now turn to the newspaper as a cultural product, we will be struck by its profound fictiveness. What is the essential literary convention of the newspaper? If we were to look at a sample front page of, say, *The New York Times*, we might find there stories about Soviet dissidents, famine in Mali, a gruesome murder, a coup in Iraq, the discovery of a rare fossil in Zimbabwe, and a speech by Mitterrand. Why are these events so juxtaposed? What connects them to each other? Not sheer caprice. Yet obviously, most of them happen independently, without the actors being aware of each other or of what the others are up to. The arbitrariness of their inclusion and juxtaposition (a later edition will substitute a baseball triumph for Mitterrand) shows that the linkage between them is imagined.

This imaginary linkage derives from two obliquely related sources. The first is simply calendrical coincidence. The date at the top of the newspaper, the single most important emblem on it, provides the essential connectionâ€”the steady onward clocking of homogeneous, empty time. Within that time, the world ambles steadily ahead. The sign for this is if Mali disappears from the pages of *The New York Times* after two days of famine reportage; for months on end, readers do not for a moment imagine that Mali has disappeared or that famine has wiped out all its citizens. The novelistic format of the newspaper assures them that somewhere out there, the character Mali moves along quietly, awaiting its next reappearance in the plot.

The second source of imagined linkage lies in the relationship between the newspaper, as a form of book, and the market. It has been estimated that in the 40-odd years between the publication of the *Gutenberg Bible* and the close of the fifteenth century, more than 20,000,000 printed volumes were produced in Europe. Between 1500 and 1600, the number manufactured had reached between 150,000,000 and 200,000,000. From early on, the printing shops looked more like modern workshops than the monastic workrooms of the Middle Ages. In 1455, Fust and Schoeffer were already running a business geared to standardized production, and twenty years later, large printing concerns were operating everywhere in Europe. In that rather special sense, the book was the first modern-style mass-produced industrial commodity. The sense I have in mind can be shown if we compare the book to other early industrial products, such as textiles, bricks, or sugar. For these commodities are measured in mathematical amounts (pounds or loads or pieces). A pound of sugar is simply a quantity, a convenient load, not an object in itself; the book, howeverâ€”and here it prefigures the durables of our timeâ€”is a distinct, self-contained object, exactly reproduced on a large scale. One pound of sugar flows into the next; each book has its own thematic self-sufficiency. (Small wonder that libraries, personal collections of mass-produced commodities, were already a familiar sight in urban centers like Paris by the sixteenth century.)

In this perspective, the newspaper is merely an extreme form of the book, a book sold on a colossal scale, but of ephemeral popularity. Might we say one-day best-sellers? The obsolescence of the newspaper on the morrow of its printingâ€”curious that one of the earlier mass-produced commodities should so prefigure the inbuilt obsolescence of modern durablesâ€”nonetheless, for just this reason, creates this extraordinary mass ceremony: the almost precisely simultaneous condition (imagining) of the newspaper-as-text. We know that particular morning and evening editions will overwhelmingly be consumed between this hour and that, only on this day, not that. (Contrast sugar, the use of which proceeds in an unlocked, continuous flow; it may go bad, but it does not go out of date.) The significance of this mass ceremonyâ€”Hegel observed that newspapers serve modern man as a substitute for morning prayersâ€”is paradoxical. It is performed in silent privacy, in the lair of the skull. Yet each communicant is well aware that the ceremony he performs is being replicated simultaneously by thousands (or millions) of others.

### IMAGINED COMMUNITIES

Everyday life. As with *Noli Me Tangere*, fiction seeps quietly and continuously into reality, creating that remarkable confidence of community in anonymity which is the hallmark of modern nations.

Before proceeding to a discussion of the specific origins of nationalism, it may be useful to recapitulate the main propositions pursued thus far. Essentially, I have been arguing that the very possibility of imagining the nation only arose historically when, and where, three fundamental cultural conceptions, all of great anguish, lost their axiomatic grip on men's minds. 

The first of these was the idea that a particular script-language offered privileged access to ontological truth precisely because it was an inseparable part of that truth. It was this idea that called into being the great transcontinental modalities of Christendom, the Islamic Ummah, and the rest. 

Second was the belief that society was naturally organized around and under high centresâ€”monarchs who were persons apart from other human beings and who ruled by some form of cosmological (divine) dispensation. Human loyalties were necessarily hierarchical and centripetal because the ruler, like the sacred script, was a node of access to being and inherent in it. 

Third was a conception of temporality in which cosmology and history were distinguishable, the origins of the world and of men essentially identical. Combined, these ideas rooted human lives firmly in the very nature of things, giving certain meaning to the everyday realities of existence (above all death, loss, and servitude) and offering, in various ways, redemption from them.

The slow, uneven decline of these interlinked certainties, first in Western Europe and later elsewhere, under the impact of economic change, 'discoveries' (social and scientific), and the development of increasingly rapid communications, drove a harsh wedge between cosmology and history. No surprise then that the search was on, so to speak, for a new way of linking fraternity, power, and time meaningfully together. Nothing perhaps more predicated this search, nor made it more fruitful, than print-capitalism, which made it possible for rapidly growing numbers of people to think about themselves and to relate themselves to others in profoundly new ways.

## The Origins of National Consciousness

If the development of print-as-commodity is the key to the generation of wholly new ideas of simultaneity, still, we are simply at the point where communities of the type 'horizontal-secular, transverse-time' become possible. Why, within that type, did the nation become so popular? The factors involved are obviously complex and varied. But a strong case can be made for the primary role of capitalism.

As already noted, at least 20,000,000 books had already been printed by 1500, signaling the onset of Benjamin's 'age of mechanical reproduction.' If manuscript knowledge was scarce and arcane lore, print knowledge lived by reproducibility and dissemination. If, as Febvre and Martin believe, possibly as many as 200,000,000 volumes had been manufactured by 1600, it is no wonder that Francis Bacon believed that 'print had changed' the appearance and state of the world.

One of the earlier forms of capitalist enterprise, book-publishing, was pivotal in this transformation.
