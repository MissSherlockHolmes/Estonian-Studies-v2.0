# Hroch, National Self-Determination

## Part 2 of 4: National Movements and Political Program

### A) Substitution
The formation of the image of the "fatherland" was a key step in national agitation, involving attempts to define ethnic territory and establish political institutions. This process often transcended political borders, where members of non-dominant ethnic groups lived on the territory of two or more political or administrative units.

### B) Participation
National participation was often discussed under the old regime, with demands for local administration and representation in central assemblies. The struggle for positions in town halls and municipal or local administrations was a common first political experience of national movements.

### C) Self-Determination
Participation represented only one part of the political program, as national leaders tried to minimize the power of the center and gain more space for independent decisions. The demand for autonomy appeared to parallel the struggle for participation in legislative and executive power, but was usually achieved later after participation had been established.

### D) Autonomy
The Magyar national movement achieved full political autonomy through the installation of Austro-Hungarian dualism in 1867, while Czech and Croatian demands for more political autonomy remained limited to the traditional institution of the Landtag. The Serbian struggle for autonomy and consequently for independence was also based upon the image of a historical national territory.

### E) National Movements and Autonomy
The demand for autonomy (not for independence!) remained the central point of the self-determination component in the program of national movements in Austria-Hungary and Russia, except for the Magyars, whose national movement successfully resulted in the achievement of a semi-state status.

### F) National Movements and Civil Rights
National movements often stressed national goals rather than civil rights, but this is based on moralistic judgments rather than facts. The linguistic and social program of national movements included demands for equality of all inhabitants, but usually did not explicitly include civil rights.

### G) National Movements and Constitutional Program
The emerging political program during the bourgeois revolutions in Central Europe in 1848 and in Russia in 1905 led to national leaders formulating political demands for participation, autonomy, constitutional, and civil rights. However, their position was complicated by the fact that the liberal party of the ruling state-nation in Austria and the democrats and socialists in Russia also fought for the same goal.

### H) National Movements and Democracy
The demands for autonomy and for independence were usually so strong that they overshadowed any strategies about the political system which might be gained. The Greeks very quickly incorporated demands for constitutionalism as an important objective, while in the Serbian, Rumanian, and later also Macedonian and Albanian movements, the constitutional issue was not discussed prior to the achievement of political success.

### I) National Movements and Democracy
The differentiation of political programs was usually between national radicals, who inclined more to democratism, and national conservatives, who maintained a conservative-liberal position. The movement towards a democratic program was easier in the case of non-dominant groups with an uncompleted social structure; national movements under the control of quickly emerging national ruling classes were inclined towards a program which marginalized democracy.

### J) National Movements and Democracy
The majority of national movements in Central and Eastern Europe achieved an independent status, even though this goal was not included in their initial and less ambitious national program. The key turning point came from external factors resulting from World War I and the October Revolution.

### K) National Movements and Democracy
Once achieved, independence was generally accepted and celebrated as a positive development and as a milestone in national history. However, the idea of the right to self-determination also became self-evident within a substantial segment of the population in those national movements, such as the Slovak, Croatian, or Ukrainian, which did not achieve full independence in 1918-1919.

### L) National Movements and Democracy
From this perspective, we have to observe the fact that the population of all newly independent states accepted the loss of their independence during the period of 1939-1948 as a collective humiliation and tragedy, without regard to the character of political oppression. Subsequently, new national movements emerged even prior to perestroika. Indeed, the demand for an independent state became a major tenet of national movements in the post-1945 period.

## Resume
This article describes the concept of national self-determination as the final and most relevant stage of European modern developments. In my view, the decisive factor in this process was the emergence, intensity, and social relevance of national identity, rather than the ideology of nationalism. This essay describes the three distinct phases of national movements, compared historically, and focuses on the political requirements related to independence. I conclude by saying that current national movements in Central Europe and Eastern Europe consider the right to self-determination as being the only and just solution to their problems, even if it produces new tensions.
